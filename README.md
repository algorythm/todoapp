# Todo App

This is a project for learning microservice-based architecture. I'm building a Todo Platform with very few functionalities, but distributed into a few small microservices.

## Technologies

I wish to try out a few different technologies for this project:

* **Traefik** for load balancing between services
* **RabbitMQ** for inter-service communication
* **Serilog** for structured logging
* **Logstash** for log parsing
* **Jaeger Tracing** as a tracing framework
* **PostgreSQL** as database

I want to use CQRS patterns for this project.
